As a matter of fact, we were their very first client, and the fact that we are still with them speaks volumes on what we have achieved together over the years. \n\nWith all the ups & downs as you would expect when moving from an in-house setup to an external one, I must say that it was not easy, but the team at H Connect International did their best to absorb, learn, and adapt.\n\nThey have learnt our business despite the distance, and today it's as if they are sitting with us in the same building.\n\nHardworking, diligent, conscientious, honest & never a sigh â€“ that's what they are about.\n\nH Connect International, thank you for your service and a big thank you to our offshore team.",
